####Understanding Your Tools:
____________________________________________________________________________

It is important to understand the relationship between the Medium and the TooL.

A Tool's purpose is that it must be useful. The Tool must fit the hand.  If the hand is different then the Tool must be different.

The Hand's relationship to the Tool is the physical expression of the Mind.

Learning how to express yourself through the chain: Product, Medium, Tool, Hand and Mind.

In our case as a web designer, we are just using text files.

Our biggest tool is the text editor.

More advanced programming environments are called IDE.

**IDE** - Integrated Developer Environment

An IDE's often include:

* Editor
* Linter
* Compiler
* Debugger
* Database
* Client

Some common IDE's are:

* Kimodo IDE
* Polyglot
* Net Beans
* Visual Studio

Other text editors include:

* Espresso
* Coda

The editor that we recommend is Sublime Text:

######Understanding Sublime Text:
Affordances are things that are provided by the tool that tell you how they should be used.b Tools teach us how to use them.

When a learning a new software tool, it is always important to start at the menus.  This is an advertisement of what the designer thinks is important


The side bars shows open folders in a given project

In the main window, is the editor.

In the far right is the file map that shows where you are in a file.

There are two maps in Sublime Text:

* Overall file structure
* Map of your location in existing file

Indentation is important for legibility and clarity


#####CUseful selection techniques:
* **Click and drag** - Continuous selection 

* **Option click** - Column select with the item to be selected and edit multiple lines at once

* **Command click** to multi-select and edit

* **Command - D** and it goes from one instance to the next instance of a word


These tools are deep and they can do a lot more than what we are telling you about. You should be able to learn tools quickly and be flexible.


You should be prepared to remap your mental map on to the tool hand.




####Understanding HTML Structure
____________________________________________________________________________


The source code of an HTML page bridges the gap between the user and the developer

We need to be able to tell the browser what kind of document that we are looking at.  In our case it is the HTML extension. The extension tells the browser that this is an HTML file.

The metatext is what tells the browser how the page should be rendered.  These might be character sets or other web standards as well navigation and organizational structures. 

Well structured code.  Drilling down. A useful technique for this indentation.

Indentation tells the developer how the page is structured.  An item indented within a tag is contained within that tag.

Indentation is important.

Standards change over time and it useful to tell the browser what standards should be used by putting it in the head tag 

A good example of changing standards is understanding the closing tag on an image.  Is it still necessary?

Most tags have opening and closing tags:

* \<head> - Head section opening tag
* \</head> - Head section closing tags

Some tags like \<img> and \<input> do not have closing tags

Here are some common tags:
<head> - A location for rules for telling the browser how the HTML should be rendered. Head is for the nerds.

* **\<meta>** - Can be used for character sets and other meta information

* **\<title>** - Title of the page in the browser tag

* **\<body>** - For the client.  The content of a page including text and images

* **\<style>** - Document specific CSS.  It is identical to what would be included in a CSS file

* **\<div>** - A division tag which is useful for providing structure to a page

* **\<img>** - An image tag that often has attribute information associated with it

* **\<a>** - An anchor tag that is connecting to more resources

Useful ideas about thinking about HTML and CSS styles:

* **Inheritance**  is when something changes from a broader context to a smaller context

* CSS uses inheritance and hierarchy to style a page
* The body is for the what the client would see.  CSS is a rule not for the client so in general, it would not belong in the body.
* Be aware of the difference between a style tag and a style attribute. A style attribute is within another tag
* In general, they should be kept separate

Valid vs legible HMTL is a very important concept. What a computer can understand and what a person can understand is different.

Legible is easy to understand by a human.  

We want our code to be both valid, legible and clear.

Tags have other more information like id, class and style

* **id** - the most specific attribute way of identifying an element
* **class** - an attribute that can be shared
* **style** - a specific style tag for an element

Comments are very important in understanding the code for you later on or someone else.

#####Structure and Presentation

The separation between content and presentation is very important.  As developer, we care about the structure.  The client cares about the content.

At times the CSS can make it seem like the HTML structured is being overridden.  A good example of this is extreme negative margins.

The CSS does not overwrite the HTML.

The HTML is technical structure of the page.

The CSS is the visual presentation of the page.

It is good practice to allow one to work with the other.
