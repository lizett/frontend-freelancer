Small Freelance project refreshing an older site.
Some useful project tools and strategies:

* Project Goal:  Install a CMS as well as a tablet and mobile theme for a site
* Take the designs from a Photoshop file and not as a jpeg
* Composites("Comps") are developed with the client for project scope
* Project requires responsive design for multiple devices
* Using a WordPress Dashboard theme to simplify process and meet the budget
* WordPress divi theme is responsive so that the developer does not  need to come up with a set of rules to define site across multiple devices
* The presentation of divi does not resmemble comp but its behavior and structure does
* divi is also responsive according to user behavior
* Using a theme is a useful compromise between developer and client
* WordPress uses PHP to render page in HTML
* Contract signing by electronic signatures in Right Signatures
* Useful project management tool is Trello
* Proiject files are shared and stored on Dropbox
* Project hours are tracked in a Google Spreadsheet
* Fixed budget, so the faster the work is done the higher the hourly rate
* Also, the more hours spent on a project, the faster the hourly rate goes down
* Code editor is Espresso
* Hosting/DNS of site will be determined by client
* Developer Tools in Chrome is very useful for looking at the site while it is in process

**CMS** - Content Management System

A CMS separates content from presentation.  It is also good for controlling costs and giving your client autonomy.


Google "The Cult of Done" manifesto:

No one wants to look at a "10" that is 75% done.


####Chrome Developer Tools:
____________________________________________________________________________

Bring up Google Chrome

Here is the Chrome Developer's site:

https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/

Right-click with mouse in browser to open the menu with Inspect Element
This opens the Inspection window with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  These come together to make the DOM of a page.

**DOM** - Document Object Model

In the **Elements** tab, the HTML of the site is displayed. CSS and Javascript is on the side.

**Style** tab displays the CSS.

**Properties** displays information on the properties of HTML objects

In the **Network** tab, if you refresh the page it will display how the site is loaded. This displays the speed of the page load.  Blue line is when the DOM is ready.  The red line is when all of the resources are loaded.

Useful measures:

**px** - Pixel 

Pixel size changes with different screen resolutions.  A good example of this the Retina displays on Apple devices.

**em** - "M"

An em is the width of a lower case letter "m".  This size changes according to the font. em is a useful relative size.

######Cache
A cache is preloaded files that are already accessible by your browser.  In other words they do not have to be downloaded again to dispay the page.

If an item is cached, then the downloaded file will not be changed and might give a message like "304 - Not Modified".

Useful page loading status message pages:
