####Understanding a Web Page
____________________________________________________________________________
Client Browser - Front end and focused on the user's concerns.

#####We have different ways of interacting with the internet today:
* Desktop web browser
* Mobile web browser
* "The internet of things" like new cars, new refrigerators, etc.
* And many more everyday

#####Common Web Browsers for both desktop and mobile browsers include:
* Chrome
* FireFox
* Internet Explorer
* Safari

Responsive design is way of thinking about the way your potential customers are and how they are interacting with your site.

**URL** - Uniform Resource Locator

**HTTP** - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

A breakdown of the path is:

**scheme://domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id**

A good resource to learn more about URL's is:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator)

URL's also appear in HTML tags for resources used in the page (fetched automatically) and, of course, hyperlinks ( fetched on click).

#####Two types of URL's:  
* Absolute URL's - Hard coded path from the home directory
* Relative URL's - A relative path usually relative to the current folder

The client browser takes the URL and finds the domain name through the path to access data on the server.  The server returns the resource back to the client as HTML.  Everything including images is transferred as text files. The client browser then parses the HTML file.

#####An HTML file includes:

* Content
* Structure
* Behavior
* and URL's to more resources

#####The browser will then go out and find all of the resources which might include:
* Media
* Content
* Images
* Stylesheets
* Behavior Languages like Javascript
* Frameworks like Bootstrap
* And many more things

Style sheets define the appearance of an HTML page.

**CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets

Browser finds all of the resources, builds the DOM and renders the page

**DOM** - Document Object Model


####Understanding Web Design Concepts:
_____________________________________________________________________
Example website:

#####Print design vs interactive web design:
Print design is often static.
A web page is not a static object.  It is dynamic and interactive.

The visual appearance of a web page is dynamic.  The tools of the web designer are much more specific and powerful.

#####To access Chrome Developer Tools:
* Open Chrome browser.
* Right click on the page to open menu and select inspect element.  This opens the Chrome Code Inspector.

#####The Code Inspector window includes:
* HTML
* Styling 
* Javascript

A Client side browser will translate the language, take the HTML  and  will actually build ("Render") the page.

Removing the CSS styling of the pages makes the page look a lot like Craigslist or a generic HTML page.

On any page there is a difference between HTML which is the content and CSS which is the styling.  It is the difference between content and presentation.  HTML is content and CSS is presentation.

The difference between markup and a programming language is the difference between meta words and magic words.

HTML is meta-text.  The HTML describe what we see, not actually what we see.  A good example of this HTML tags that organize a page but we never see them when we view a page.

**HTML is a metatext**.  Text about text.

**Markdown is also metatext**.  Text about how text is structured.

We also only see the HTML body when we open a page.

Scrolling through the Code Inspector allows us to see the hierarchy of the HTML of the page.

Describing Contexts:
The HTML context is about how a word appears.  Context is one of the biggest ideas in markup languages.

The fundamental question of any markup language:

**Is this text or is this text about text?**

Text about texts are often included in HTML tags. A simplified meta text language is called markdown.

[Mou 2](http://mouapp.com/) is a good example of a markdown editor.

Markdown's tags can easily be converted into HTML. 

#####HTML Tags include:
* Attributes 
* Values
* Content

#####Common HTML tags include
* \<body>
* \<header>
* \<div>
* \<a>
* \<p>
* \<img>
* \<script>
* \<style> (for CSS style! in an HTML file)
* and many more

Web designers are often concerned with the metatext, the way that information is structured.  Our clients are often concerned with content, the information between the meta-text( or tags).


#####Understanding CSS:

Like HTML, CSS is a also metatext.  CSS is about the way a sheet is styled and not the content.

**CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets

In Chrome Code Inspector select the CSS in the right window.

#####The box model:
* size
* margin
* border
* padding

#####An example of a CSS description is:
```
.wrap {

margin-left:auto;
margin-right:auto;
width:960px;
border:80px goldenrod solid;

}
```
In this case,  .wrap says these rules will be only applied to the HTML class "wrap".
CSS is a list of rules that tell the browser how the HTML should be rendered.

To learn more about [HTML and CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)...

And the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)  (MDN)



#####What does Cascading mean?
A hierarchy of information, from element to element and top to bottom.  When organizing a CSS page, the higher up it is in the page the more general the rule is. Further down the page, the style scope become increasingly more specific.

A typical CSS sheet as it goes from top to bottom, goes from the most general to the most specific. It is a set of a list of rules that apply to specific labels in the HTML text.

#####Understanding CSS Hierarchy

**More specific ALWAYS WINS**

From specific to general:

1. ELEMENT STYLE
2. ID - #intro (id's always begin with a pound sign "#")
3. CLASS - .article (classes always begin with a period ".")
4. TAG - div ( tags do not have any markup)
5. DOCUMENT  INHERITANCE - (inherits style from HTML structure)

Each ID can only be used once and refer to a specific element.  A class can be applied to multiple elements.

CSS can be inheriting from the containing tag in the HTML.  This is useful when HTML tags are included within other HTML tags.  This is the least specific way of applying CSS to an HTML element.

A good place to practice HTML and CSS is a tool called jsfiddle:

#####Some HTML and CSS tips:
* It is always a good idea to create your closing HTML tag right after making the opening tag.
* Tags are used to define elements in the DOM (Document Object Model)

* Every HTML or CSS tag has the name of the tag and its attributes
* A more specific the CSS tag will override less specific tags
* Semi-colons separate statements
* Use the resources that are available to you
* Command-Tab or Alt-Tab to move between programs
* **Remember, you need to play all the time!**


#####Here is a short example of some of the things that we have discussed:

#####HTML:
```
\<h1>This is a heading\</h1>

\<p>This is a paragraph\</p>

\<p style="color:red">Liar!\</p>

\<p class="blue">This is blue text \</p>

\<p class="sad">This is a sad paragraph\</p>

\<p style="color:darkblue; font-style:italic;"class="sad">This is a really sad paragraph\</p>
```



#####CSS:
```
.blue {
    color:blue;
}

.sad{
    color:lightblue;
}
```

#####Result:
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<p style="color:red">Liar!</p>
<p class="blue">This is blue text </p>
<p class="sad">This is a sad paragraph</p>
<p style="color:darkblue; font-style:italic;"class="sad">This is a really sad paragraph</p>
